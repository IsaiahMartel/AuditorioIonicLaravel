## Organization
Straight to the point I think I did not organized good enough.
But to fair, it can be more about I could expend more time on the project, but anyways, I think I could organize a lot better.
My organization consisted most of the time in having the idea of what I was gonna do that day of working, every few days organzing the ideas on how much I had to expend
on the project or what I could reach that week, doing appointments with the client from time to time and sometimes, what I had to do more often, writting down what I had ahead,
specifying every step and time (with the minimum and maximun I know could take me) for the next day.
The main thing I think I needed was beign more specified with my ideas, the things I had to do (because many times I did not even know where to start before start doing it), 
and beign more realistic with the time I have for doing it and specify how much time I will be expending with every little thing, because I am the type of person that can be
obssesd about if this button should have between 2 or 15 pixeles to be pretty and testing every pixel between, to put it in an hyperbolic way. But that is when I don't have
a lead to say "okay I need to expend X maximum time on this, and Y maximum time on that other thing, and I think I can make both to look good enough in this Z time", because when
it's that so I can stick very easily, and that is what I have been demostrating to myself this lasts days of the project.

## Conclusions 
The project has been tough, I think not because it was that tough, but more because I really did not have the habit to work in a consistent way. Although it has been enjoyable
in many ways, but I do not think was that enjoyable for me that is for many class-mates that I see that excited with theirs, and not gonna lie that's something I wanted to have.
But I did not have the strength to work the enough time I should, my time working on the project has been almost all working on class, without counting the last week that 
I have not assisted but I avanced a lot. With everything (sadly because has been on the end) I'm starting to acquire the 
habit to work more in a consistent way and have been very enjoyable and releiving; and I look towards updating this project and working in other projects with this feeling.

I obviously talking about the most important thing for me right now, but the process had very ups and downs: at the start and in some points was very exciting, I learned a lot
aobut technologies, I know now how is talking to a client and showing what I was working on, changing things and sharing ideas between him and with mates...

I think I really grow up in this process, and now I know better how to organize myself and work, having everything clearer and with those first steps on how it will be in a 
future.
