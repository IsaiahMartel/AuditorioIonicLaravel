## Technologies-comparation
Our application is an hybrid one, since with develop it we created the backend as an api, so it can be used with some other frontend; and with use
Ionic, an open source toolkit, which uses HTML, CSS y JavaScript*, like every other hybrid app. Ionic can be used with many frameworks and we decided to use Angular,
so *we used SCSS (it is very much likely CSS but with some additions that we did not even used) and Typescript (it is like Javascript but strongly typed).
We did not reach the principe at 100% because we knew the app will be only using in mobiles, so there was no point in making it responsive for web or pc.
